# Prompting Techniques and Building RAG Apps with LLMs

This repository contains guides on learning two fundamental concepts about LLMs:
1. Prompting Techniques
2. Building RAG Applications

**Prompting Techniques**
This notebook dives into the principles of prompting and demonstrates the right way to prompt LLM. At the end of it, we build a chatbot using these prompting techniques. It uses the Gemini LLM from Google to perform these tasks.

**Building RAG Applications**
This notebook demonstrates how to build RAG applications using the LangChain framework. Implemented as a simple streamlit application that answers questions about the textbook "An Introduction to Statistical Learning". It uses Chroma for vector storage, OpenAI for both embeddings and as the LLM.
